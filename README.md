# GiesCoin
> My attempt of creating a decentralized blockchain and cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies are digital assets people use as investments and for purchases online. You exchange real currency, like dollars, to purchase “coins” or “tokens” of a given cryptocurrency. There are many kinds of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the most famous, but Ether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ripple are a few others. This is my take on this new technology that has a lot to offer.
